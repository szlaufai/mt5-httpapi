The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): patch = bug fixes / docs, minor = backwards-compatible features, major = breaking changes.

---

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added read-only `GET /symbols/<symbol>/margin?volume=...` for
  `trade_calc_mode=4` symbols. It calls MT5 `order_calc_margin` for BUY and SELL
  at the current ask/bid and returns both margin amounts and effective rates,
  without placing an order. The Go client and both MCP surfaces expose the same
  operation. The unified MCP regression check now expects the resulting
  26-tool surface.

## [v4.9.3] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **The README's "Make Targets" list was missing `make test-mcpunifier`**, added in v4.9.2. That list is where a contributor looks for the supported operations, so a target absent from it is a target nobody runs. It now matches `make help` exactly, and carries a short note on what the target checks and that it needs the docker socket.

## [v4.9.2] — 2026-07-28

### Added

- **`make test-mcpunifier`** — an end-to-end test for the MCP unifier, which had no automated coverage: `scripts/lint.sh` only reaches `.ps1` and `.sh` files, so nothing verified `mcpunifier/`. `scripts/test-mcpunifier.sh` builds the unifier image, stands it up beside a stub terminal on a scratch network, and asserts seven behaviours — health, the 25-tool surface, `list_terminals` reporting every configured terminal, a live terminal routing to its own port, a configured-but-down terminal failing only the calls that name it, a broker/account pair that is not configured being refused rather than routed, and the service staying healthy after both failures.
- Every resource the harness creates carries one name prefix and is removed by an `EXIT` trap, so a pass, a failure and an interrupt all leave nothing behind. It also sweeps that prefix on entry, so a run killed outright — where the trap never fires — is cleaned up by the next invocation. On a readiness timeout it dumps each container's state and last log lines *before* tearing down, since the teardown would otherwise destroy the only evidence of why the run failed.
- Fixtures are written under the gitignored `.data/` rather than `/tmp`: a bind-mount source is resolved on the docker daemon's filesystem, so a `mktemp -d` directory that exists only in the caller's namespace would be bound as an empty dir and the service would start with no configuration.

## [v4.9.1] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **A missing `mcpunifier` container no longer stops nginx from starting and takes every other route down with it.** v4.9.0 generated `location /mcp/` with a literal `proxy_pass http://mcpunifier:6600/`. nginx resolves a literal upstream hostname while *parsing* the config, so on a deployment without that container nginx aborts with `host not found in upstream "mcpunifier"` — and every per-terminal route plus the whole REST API returns 502 behind it. Because `docker-compose.yml` is gitignored, pulling v4.9.0 delivered the new `scripts/config_helper.py` without the service it referenced, so the next restart broke the stack.
- The upstream now routes through a variable (`set $mcp_upstream …;` then `proxy_pass $mcp_upstream;`) with an explicit `resolver`, which defers the lookup to request time. nginx starts whether or not the container exists, every terminal route serves normally, and only `/mcp/` returns 502 until the unifier is running — which makes the service genuinely optional, as it needs to be.

## [v4.9.0] — 2026-07-28

### Added

- **Unified MCP endpoint at `/mcp`, spanning every configured terminal.** Each terminal already had its own MCP server at `/<broker>/<account>/mcp`, and a session was permanently bound to whichever one it connected to — an MCP session has a fixed tool catalog, so there was no per-call slot to name a terminal. The new endpoint exposes the same 24 tools, each taking `broker` and `account` (plus optional `instance`), so one session can drive every terminal.
- **`list_terminals`**, reporting each configured terminal's broker, account, instance and whether it is a live or demo account. Every other tool refuses a broker/account pair that is not configured and answers with the valid list, rather than routing to something plausible but wrong.
- **`mcpunifier` service** (`mcpunifier/`, `Dockerfile.mcpunifier`) — a Linux container running beside the Windows VM. It reads the same `config/config.yaml` that generates the nginx routing, so it cannot route somewhere nginx does not, and reaches each terminal directly on that terminal's own port. `nginx` proxies `/mcp/` to it.

### Notes

- **Nothing existing changes.** The per-terminal `/<broker>/<account>/mcp` endpoints and the whole REST surface are untouched. Which endpoint a client reaches depends only on the URL it is pointed at: a root URL gets the unified tools, a `/<broker>/<account>` URL gets that terminal's existing tools.
- **No startup coupling and no shared failure.** The unifier never waits on a terminal — the routing table is static and is not re-probed. A terminal that is down fails only the calls naming it and leaves the rest usable; successful responses carry the `terminal` key that answered. `/health` reports whether the unifier can route, never a terminal's state.
- The unified endpoint is gated by the same bearer token as the REST API. The service runs as a non-root user with a read-only root filesystem and all Linux capabilities dropped, and mounts `config/config.yaml` read-only.
- `scripts/config_helper.py` now refuses to generate nginx config for a broker literally named `mcp`, which would otherwise shadow the unified route.

### Changed

- **Docs and plugin manifests now describe both MCP endpoints.** The README's MCP section, the Claude Code manifest's `api_url` prompt, and the OpenClaw bridge's `MT5_API_URL` all previously described the base URL as terminal-scoped only, which was the entire truth before this release and is now half of it. Each states that the server root reaches every terminal while a `/<broker>/<account>` path pins one, so the value a user is prompted for no longer steers them into single-terminal mode without mentioning the alternative.

## [v4.8.4] — 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- The README's Codex subsection under `## Agent integrations` stopped after `codex plugin marketplace add psyb0t/agents` and never told the reader how to actually install the plugin. Added the missing command, `codex plugin add mt5-httpapi@psyb0t`.
- Clarified that skill invocation differs by install path: a marketplace-installed skill invokes as `$mt5-httpapi:mt5-httpapi`, while a skill Codex picks up automatically from a repo's own `.agents/skills/` invokes as plain `$mt5-httpapi`.

## [v4.8.3] — 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Codex plugin manifest** (`.agents/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`) — points `skills` at `.agents/skills/`, so mt5-httpapi installs as a distribution channel via `codex plugin marketplace add psyb0t/agents`. The skill itself already worked in Codex with zero files (native `.agents/skills/` scanning); this only adds discovery.
- **`## Agent integrations` README section** with copy-pasteable install commands for Claude Code, Codex, and the OpenClaw skill + MCP-bridge plugin, linked from the Table of Contents.

### Fixed

- The README's prior Claude Code install snippet pointed `claude plugin marketplace add` at this repo directly, which has no `marketplace.json` and would fail. It now points at the shared catalog, `psyb0t/agents`.

### Removed

- Deleted the stray `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` from this repo — marketplaces register by name and collide across repos; the catalog now lives solely in `psyb0t/agents`.

## [v4.8.2] — 2026-07-27

### Added

- Added a GitHub Actions CI status badge to the README.

## [v4.8.1] — 2026-07-27

### Added

- Added self-hosted version and license badges; wired a badges job into pipeline.yml.

## [v4.8.0] — 2026-07-26

MCP interface reworked from a single generic passthrough to dedicated, typed tools.

### Changed

- **`/mcp` now exposes ~24 dedicated typed tools** grouped by family (market data, account, positions, orders, history, terminal, backtest) instead of the lone generic `request` passthrough. Each tool has typed params + a description the agent reads — e.g. `create_order(symbol, type, volume, price?, sl?, tp?)`, `get_rates(symbol, timeframe, count?)`, `close_position(ticket, volume?)` — so the tool schema IS the documentation. Order/position mutation tools carry an explicit irreversible-live-account note. A generic `request` + `endpoints` catalog remain as a fallback for routes without a dedicated tool. Every tool still runs the same handler + auth + MT5 locking as a real HTTP call (in-process). README + skill + plugin docs updated.
- Submitting a backtest (`POST /backtest`) is **not** exposed as a tool — that route takes a multipart file upload; `get_backtest` polls status/report/log/tail, and new runs are submitted via the REST API.

## [v4.7.0] — 2026-07-26

New MCP interface — the API is now also driveable over the Model Context Protocol.

### Added

- **MCP server mounted at `/mcp`** (streamable-HTTP), in the same process as the REST API on every terminal. Three tools mirror the whole REST surface: `ping` (lock-free liveness), `endpoints` (the route catalog), and `request(method, path, query, body)` — call any REST endpoint, running the exact same handler + auth + MT5 locking as a real HTTP request. Same bearer auth as REST (empty `api_token` = auth off; a configured token requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on `/mcp` too). See `mt5api/mcp_server.py`.
- **`@psyb0t/mt5-httpapi` ClawHub plugin** (`.agents/plugins/mt5-httpapi/`) — a stdio↔HTTP MCP bridge (`mcp-remote`) so an OpenClaw/MCP agent can drive a running terminal. Point `MT5_API_URL` at the terminal's base (+ `MT5_API_TOKEN` if auth is on); the reachable endpoint is `$MT5_API_URL/mcp/`. CI publishes it to ClawHub alongside the skill.
- README and the `mt5-httpapi` skill gain an **MCP interface** section.

### Note

- mt5api is a Flask/WSGI app; the ASGI MCP app is bridged in via `a2wsgi` behind `/mcp` (there's a `TODO` to migrate mt5api to FastAPI and drop the bridge). New runtime deps `mcp` + `a2wsgi` are installed by `scripts/start.bat` on boot and tracked in `requirements-api.txt`. No REST endpoint or trading-path change.

## [v4.6.0] — 2026-07-26

Hotfix for a boot-blocking regression introduced in v4.5.0, plus a `make lint` / `make format` gate so that class of bug cannot reach the VM again.

### Fixed

- **v4.5.0's `scripts/acquire_lock.ps1` deadlocked every boot.** The file contained em-dashes in comments *and in string literals*, with no UTF-8 BOM. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads `.ps1` as ANSI, so those bytes were mangled, the string literals terminated early, and the script died with `Unexpected token` / `The hash literal was incomplete`. The script is now pure ASCII, which needs no BOM to stay stable.
- **A failing lock helper was indistinguishable from a held lock.** `acquire_lock.ps1` used exit 1 for "another instance holds the lock" — the same code PowerShell returns for a parse error. So the syntax error above made `start.bat` conclude the lock was taken and exit, on every boot, which is the exact deadlock the lock rewrite was meant to remove. Exit codes are now distinct: `0` acquired, `10` held, anything else means the helper itself failed. On that third case `scripts/start.bat` and `scripts/install.bat` log a warning and fall back to a plain `mkdir` lock, so a broken helper can degrade single-instance safety but can never block boot.
- `scripts/event-log-tailer.ps1`: em-dashes in comments replaced with ASCII (same mojibake hazard); `Append-Full` renamed to `Add-FullLogLine` (`Add` is an approved PowerShell verb); its `catch {}` no longer swallows silently — a failed `full.log` append is now reported into `windows-events.log`, which is not the contended file that just failed.

### Added

- **`make lint`** — lints every tracked-or-new script in a throwaway Docker image (built, run, `docker rmi`'d, repo mounted read-only), mirroring how `make test` works. Six checks: a self-test of its own non-ASCII detector, the `.ps1` ASCII gate, a `.ps1` parse check, PSScriptAnalyzer, shellcheck (warning and above), and shfmt. `Dockerfile.lint` + `scripts/lint.sh`.
  - The detector self-test exists because a checker that silently stops detecting is worse than no checker — the same failure mode as the healthcheck fixed in v4.5.0. It verifies the pattern still flags a real em-dash and still passes pure ASCII, and fails the whole run if it cannot tell them apart.
  - Files are selected with `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard`, so brand-new scripts are covered while gitignored local scratch is not. The vendored `scripts/defender-remover/` tree is excluded.
- **`make format`** — applies shfmt in place. Delegates to `scripts/lint.sh --format` so it shares file selection with `make lint`; when the two had separate lists, `format` skipped untracked files that `lint` still flagged and the gate could never go green.

### Changed

- Applied shfmt formatting to `run.sh`, `test.sh`, `scripts/rotate-logs.sh`, and `tests/real/run.sh`. Whitespace and layout only — no behavior change. In `test.sh` this expands single-line function bodies (`pass() { echo …; PASS=…; }`) onto separate lines, which is most of the diff.
- README's Make Targets list now includes `lint`, `format`, and `test` (`test` had been missing).

## [v4.5.0] — 2026-07-26

Boot-lock and reboot hardening for the Windows VM, a critical healthcheck false-positive fix, and a `make test` build fix. Also adds third-party license notices for the vendored Windows Defender removal tool.

### Fixed

- **Healthcheck reported dead terminals as healthy.** `scripts/healthcheck.sh` probed each terminal with `curl … -w '%{http_code}' … || echo 000`. curl already prints `000` on a failed connection, so the `|| echo 000` fallback appended a second one — yielding `000000`, which compared unequal to `000` and marked the port UP. A full outage could sit behind a green Docker healthcheck indefinitely. The probe now whitelists a valid HTTP status shape (`[1-5][0-9][0-9]`) and fails closed; any real status, including 4xx/5xx, proves the process is listening.
- **Reboot-orphaned boot locks deadlocked the stack.** `%SHARED%\start.running` (and install.bat's lock) live on the host-mounted volume and survive a VM reboot. The auto-reboot task fires `shutdown /r /t 0 /f` with no grace period and can land mid-run, stranding the lock so every later boot bailed on the orphan forever. New `scripts/acquire_lock.ps1` stamps each lock with the OS boot time, so a lock from a previous boot is provably ownerless and is cleared automatically; a live same-boot instance still blocks. `scripts/start.bat` and `scripts/install.bat` acquire through it and release via a single `release_lock`.
- **`make test` was dead on a clean checkout.** `Dockerfile.test` COPYed `config/requirements.txt`, which had been retired and is gitignored, so the build failed with `"/config/requirements.txt": not found`. Tests now install from the tracked `requirements-api.txt`, additionally COPY `scripts/config_helper.py` (loaded by `tests/test_terminal_instances.py`), and skip the live-deployment `tests/real/` suite in the default offline run.

### Added

- `scripts/reboot.bat` — the single reboot path for the VM. Writes `rebooting.flag` and releases both lock dirs in one place, replacing three separate inline flag+shutdown+rmdir sequences that had to be kept in sync.
- `requirements-api.txt` — tracked source of truth for the mt5api HTTP server's Python dependencies (replacing the retired, gitignored `config/requirements.txt`). `scripts/start.bat` installs the same set inline on every boot. Retains the documented `numpy<2` pin — the MetaTrader5 `5.0.5735` wheel is built against numpy 1.x, and under numpy 2.x `order_send` fails with `(-2, 'Unnamed arguments not allowed')`.

### Changed

- Renamed the boot entrypoint `start-mt5.bat` → `start.bat` and its log `start-mt5.log` → `start.log`; README file-tree and log references updated to match.

### Licensing

- Added `THIRD_PARTY.md` and `scripts/defender-remover/LICENSE` (GPL-3.0). `scripts/defender-remover/` is a verbatim vendored copy of the third-party windows-defender-remover tool, which is GPL-3.0-licensed; the rest of mt5-httpapi stays WTFPL. Documents the licensing of what the repo actually distributes.

## [v4.4.3] — 2026-07-26

Docs: hardened the `mt5-httpapi` agent skill with explicit destructive-operation guardrails and an auth/exfil-style warning. Renamed the safety section to `## Security & safety`, spelled out that trade/order/position mutations are irreversible with no client-side auto-retry, and made the "empty `api_token` = unauthenticated" warning more explicit. No behavior, endpoint, or API change.

## [v4.4.2] — 2026-07-25

CI: switch the ClawHub skill publish to `clawhub-publish.yml` directly — the `clawhub-skills-publish-workflow.yml` shim was removed upstream. No trading-path or API change.

## [v4.3.1] — 2026-05-17

Critical trading-path fixes + integration test suite.

### Fixed

- `order_send` / `order_check` now use `**kwargs` unpacking. MetaTrader5 wheel `5.0.5735` `_core.pyd` is keyword-only for these calls — a positional dict fails in 0ms with the misleading `(-2, 'Unnamed arguments not allowed')` before any IPC to the terminal. Read-only calls were unaffected, which is why the regression hid for so long. Applies to `mt5api/handlers/orders.py` (create / update / cancel) and `mt5api/handlers/positions.py` (SL/TP modify, close).
- `update_order` referenced the non-existent `TradeOrder.expiration` field — now uses `time_expiration`. Previously surfaced as a 500 with HTML body on `PUT /orders/<ticket>`.
- `create_order` now waits for the first non-zero tick after auto-selecting a freshly-added symbol (10 × 0.2s). Fixes "Cannot get price" on the very first market order after a cold boot, when `symbol_select` succeeds but the tick subscription hasn't filled yet.

### Added

- `mt5client.ensure_symbol()` — moved out of `symbols.py` so order handlers can auto-select the symbol on every trade entry, not just on `/symbols/<s>` reads. Trade endpoints no longer require the caller to pre-warm a symbol via `/symbols/<s>/tick`.
- `tests/real/` — live-API integration suite (pytest). 35 tests covering account, ping/terminal, symbols (info/tick/rates/ta/ticks), orders (list/create/get/update/cancel), positions (list/get/update/close), history (orders/deals). Magic-number-tagged so it can run against a live demo account in parallel with manual trading without disturbing it.
- `scripts/start.bat`: auto-reboot when pip installs or upgrades a package on boot. Detects "Successfully installed" in pip output and triggers `shutdown /r` so already-running `api_runner` processes don't keep stale imports.

### Infra

- Pin `numpy<2` in `scripts/install.bat` and `scripts/start.bat`. The MetaTrader5 wheel is built against numpy 1.x ABI; defensive measure even though the `unnamed arguments` regression was caused by the kwargs issue, not the numpy ABI.

## [v4.3.0] — 2026-05-14

**MT5 Strategy Tester HTTP API + per-terminal live/backtest mode.** Lands PR #2 from `algotradingspace/backtester` (Marin). A tester-mode terminal now runs alongside live terminals on the same Docker / Windows VM deployment, behind the same `/<broker>/<account>/...` nginx routing.

### Why `mode` exists

MT5 is single-instance per portable data directory. A running `terminal64.exe` holds an exclusive lock on its dir; any second `terminal64.exe` spawned against the same dir exits silently with code 0. That makes it impossible to drive the Strategy Tester through a terminal that's also backing the live SDK. `mode` declares intent at terminal-startup time so a single install can run both kinds side by side.

### Added

- New endpoints: `POST /backtest/build-ini`, `POST /backtest`, `GET /backtest/<job_id>`, `GET /backtest/<job_id>/report`, `GET /backtest/<job_id>/log`.
- `GET /ping` now echoes `{"status":"ok","mode":"<live|backtest>"}`.
- New per-terminal field `mode: live | backtest` in `config.yaml` (defaults to `live`).
- New per-terminal field `symbol_suffix` — optional broker-specific suffix appended to `[Tester].Symbol` so the same EA/.set/.ini can run against multiple brokers with different symbol naming.
- Configurable backtest timeout with 4-tier override chain: POST form field `timeout` → `config.yaml.backtest_timeout` → `BACKTEST_TIMEOUT` env → hardcoded `DEFAULT_BACKTEST_TIMEOUT="6h"`. Reuses `parse_duration_to_seconds` (same grammar as `utc_offset`).
- Host-managed asset pool: `./assets/experts/` + `./assets/sets/` mounted read-only into the VM, referenced from `POST /backtest` via `expert_name` / `set_name` (inline upload still works).
- Parsed report summary now includes `bars` / `ticks` / `symbols` so empty-history failures are visible in JSON without opening the HTML.
- `psutil` added to base pip install (was already imported by `mt5client.py` but missing from the install list).

### Changed

- Generated nginx config now sets `client_max_body_size 25m` + `client_body_timeout 120s` so EA + `.set` uploads up to ~25 MB succeed.
- `reboot_interval=0` is now respected at startup so long backtest runs aren't interrupted by the scheduled auto-reboot.

### Security / safety

- Tester INI is re-encoded UTF-16-LE+BOM+CRLF before MT5 reads it (MT5 silently rejects `[Tester] Login` under UTF-8).
- `[Common].Login/Password/Server` are always overwritten from the URL-selected account in `config.yaml` — the caller cannot inject credentials.
- Path traversal in `expert_name` / `set_name` is rejected.
- Concurrency: one tester per API process, serialized by an internal `RUN_LOCK`; additional submissions queue. Jobs left in-flight when the API restarts are marked failed by `sweep_orphans()` at next boot.

### Compatibility

Fully additive. `mode` defaults to `live`; existing config files keep working verbatim. Live terminal API surface, multi-terminal routing, Docker/VM deployment, and the v4 single-file config model are all unchanged.

## [v4.2.2] — 2026-05-13

Sync docs + example compose to **wickworks v0.3.x** (primitives-only, camelCase-canonical).

- README and SKILL.md drop divergence claims, add primitives-only disclaimer, fix the `indicators` spec example to the flat shape.
- SKILL.md indicator catalog rewritten with real registry names across 8 trader-meaningful categories; missing alt-MAs added.
- `docker-compose.yml.example` pin bumped `psyb0t/wickworks:v0.2.0 → v0.3.1` so a fresh install no longer ships the pre-purification image.
- Go client `RatesTAQuery` doc comment fixed (flat indicator shape; `RecentBars` marked inert).

No runtime code changes.

## [v4.2.1] — 2026-05-13

Surface the TA capability prominently in docs.

- README intro leads with built-in TA, adds a Table of Contents.
- SKILL.md gets a dedicated Technical Analysis section.
- Both docs link to `github.com/psyb0t/docker-wickworks` for the indicator catalog.

No code changes.

## [v4.2.0] — 2026-05-13

**Go client gains `GetRatesTA`** matching the wickworks TA endpoint from v4.1.0.

- New `Client.GetRatesTA(ctx, symbol, RatesTAQuery{Indicators, ...})`.
- New `RatesTAQuery` + `RatesTAResponse` types.

## [v4.1.0] — 2026-05-13

**Wickworks TA sidecar + `POST /symbols/<symbol>/rates/ta`** — one call returns OHLC bars plus indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger, ADX, SMC primitives, etc.) computed by the wickworks sidecar.

- New wickworks sidecar (`psyb0t/wickworks`), netns-shared with `mt5`, no published ports, VM-reachable via `20.20.20.1:8000`.
- `config.yaml` gains optional `wickworks: { url, timeout }`.
- Backwards compatible — existing endpoints unchanged.
- **Manual upgrade step:** copy the `wickworks:` service block from `docker-compose.yml.example` into your `docker-compose.yml`.

## [v4.0.1] — 2026-05-07

Post-v4.0.0 stability fixes.

- `install.bat`: skip the install loop when every broker already has its `base/terminal64.exe`. The v4.0.0 loop set `NEEDS_REBOOT=1` once per boot, triggering an infinite reboot loop.
- `start.bat`: switched API_TOKEN load from `for /f` to a tempfile read — the for/f form occasionally returned empty (python crash / pyyaml install / stdout buffering through the cmd subshell).
- `run.sh`: added `SKIP_KVM_CHECK` env escape hatch for hosts that proxy KVM differently (CI, nested virt).
- `config_helper.py` + `run.sh`: new `port_list` subcommand that prints individual ports space-separated, for per-port iteration in `run.sh`.

## [v4.0.0] — 2026-05-07 — BREAKING

**Single `config/config.yaml` replaces seven separate config files.** Migrate from `config/config.yaml.example`.

The retired files: `accounts.json`, `terminals.json`, `api_token.txt`, `ts_authkey.txt`, `ts_login_server.txt`, `reboot_interval.txt`, `requirements.txt`.

Also pins all docker images to specific versions (`dockurr/windows:5.14`, `nginx:1.30.0-alpine3.23`, `cloudflare/cloudflared:2026.3.0`, `tailscale/tailscale:v1.96.5`, `python:3.12-slim-bookworm`) in response to the Trivy/KICS supply-chain incidents on Docker Hub.

---

## [v3.2.0] — 2026-05-07

Daily log rotation sidecar with 7-day retention.

## [v3.1.2] — 2026-05-07

Tee Windows events into `full.log` alongside `windows-events.log`.

## [v3.1.1] — 2026-05-07

Windows event log tailer for OOM / crash / BSOD visibility from outside the VM.

## [v3.1.0] — 2026-05-07

**Concurrency hardening.** Per-request MT5 lock + per-call SDK timeouts + queue-depth backpressure. Fixes wedge-induced connection-refused failures that surfaced under sustained load.

## [v3.0.3] — 2026-05-07

Tailscale sidecar TUN mode (`TS_USERSPACE=false`). Accurate inbound-vs-outbound isolation docs.

## [v3.0.2] — 2026-05-07

Wire tailscale serve via CLI (FQDN-aware), drop static `serve.json` — fixes Headscale + bare-host dispatch.

## [v3.0.1] — 2026-05-07

Fix tailscale `serve.json` (`TCP[80].HTTP=true`); Cloudflare Tunnel docs.

## [v3.0.0] — 2026-05-07 — BREAKING

**nginx always-on single entry point**, `/<broker>/<account>/` URL prefix, tailscale own-netns ACL isolation.

All terminals are now routed through a single nginx instance instead of per-terminal port exposure. Callers move from `host:<port>/...` to `host:<api_port>/<broker>/<account>/...`. Tailscale (optional) runs in its own netns so it gets its own tailnet identity.

---

## [v2.2.0] — 2026-05-06

Optional Tailscale + nginx sidecars for tailnet exposure. Auto-generated from `terminals.json`, Headscale-compatible.

## [v2.1.0] — 2026-05-05

nginx-style request logs, switched to waitress WSGI server, retry-doubling on terminal init failure, `from+to` range mode for rates/ticks, pytest suite.

## [v2.0.1] — 2026-05-05

Fix `rates` signed-count direction — `copy_rates_from` goes backward, not forward.

## [v2.0.0] — 2026-05-05 — BREAKING

`rates` / `ticks`: drop `to` parameter, use signed `count` for direction. Forward queries use positive count, backward queries use negative.

---

## [v1.8.2] — 2026-05-04

Go client: `uint64` for `tick_volume` / `real_volume` / `volume` to match MQL5 `ulong`.

## [v1.8.1] — 2026-05-04

Proper full-URL logging; fix rates returned when requested date is beyond what the broker has on file.

## [v1.8.0] — 2026-05-04

**Normalize broker timestamps to real UTC** via per-terminal `utc_offset`. MT5 returns timestamps in broker wall-clock time disguised as unix UTC; this offset corrects them on the wire. Negative values allowed for west-of-UTC brokers.

## [v1.7.3] — 2026-05-03

Make `docker-compose.yml` user-owned; ship `.example` template.

## [v1.7.2] — 2026-05-03

Healthcheck: dynamic per-port probing via dnsmasq VM IP.

## [v1.7.1] — 2026-05-03

Docs: clarify 512M memory-limit caveats for heavy scraping.

## [v1.7.0] — 2026-05-02

`rates` / `ticks` time-range, tick flags, auto symbol-select, gzip response compression.

## [v1.6.0] — 2026-05-02

**Typed Go client** at `clients/go/` covering all endpoints.

## [v1.5.x] — 2026-04-08 → 2026-04-27

Startup polish + documentation iteration (`v1.5.0` shipped bearer-token auth via `--token` / `API_TOKEN` / `config/api_token.txt`, auth on all routes, cloudflared tunnel commented into docker-compose; subsequent patches were minor doc/startup tweaks).

## [v1.4.0] — 2026-02-28

**Observability + self-healing.** Structured logging, health monitor, terminal restart, boot fix.

- Centralized logging (`logger.py`) with identity prefix and cross-process file locking for shared `full.log`.
- Health monitor thread: checks login status, algo trading, auto-restarts dead terminals after 5 consecutive failures.
- Terminal restart via API (`POST /terminal/restart`) using WMI kill + PowerShell `Start-Process RunAs` for elevated launch.
- HTTP request/response logging (skipping `/ping`).
- Fixed `start.bat` goto-inside-call bug (replaced with `for /L` loop).
- Added `psutil` dependency.

## [v1.3.0] — 2026-02-23

**Multi-terminal boot overhaul, debloat fixes, settings cleanup.**

- Rename docker-compose service `metatrader5 → mt5`, volume `data/metatrader5 → data/shared`.
- Restructure shared dir: `scripts/`, `config/`, `terminals/` subdirs.
- `install.bat`: 4-stage sequential boot (schtask+UAC, debloat, python, terminals) with atomic mkdir lock + stale-lock cleanup after reboot.
- `start.bat` (renamed from `start-mt5.bat`): multi-terminal via `terminals.json`; deletes stale `settings.ini` + `common.ini` per boot so MT5 actually reads `mt5start.ini`; pip failure is now fatal.
- `debloat.bat`: removed `Ndu` from `sc stop` (kernel driver, hangs forever); added firewall disable; fixed defender-remover path.
- `mt5api/config.py`: fixed paths for `config/` subdir, simplified `terminal64.exe` lookup.

## [v1.2.0] — 2026-02-21

**Multi-terminal fixes, boot stability, login verification.**

- Fix reboot loop: separate `oem-install.bat` stub so only one `install.bat` path runs.
- Fix concurrent instances: atomic mkdir lock instead of file-based lock (race condition).
- Fix MT5 auto-updater reboots: kill `liveupdate.exe` / `mtupdate.exe` on startup.
- `ensure_initialized`: verify `account_info()` login after terminal connects, call `mt5.login()` if not logged in.
- Wrap `account_info()` in 15s timeout to prevent hangs.
- Remove legacy single-terminal fallback (`terminals.json` now required).
- Disable UAC on VM (headless, no need for it).

## [v1.1.0] — 2026-02-19

Multi-terminal support on a single machine — multiple broker/account terminals running in the same Windows VM, each on its own port.

## [v1.0.0] — 2026-02-15

Initial public release. MT5 terminal running inside a `dockurr/windows` VM, exposed via a Python HTTP API for live trading and market data.
